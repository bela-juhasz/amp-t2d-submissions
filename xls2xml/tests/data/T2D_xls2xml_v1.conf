#Configuration for defining which fields in which worksheets to be parsed in an Excel file
#
#At the top level, "worksheets" defines a list of worksheets (titles) to be parsed.
#Then for each worksheet, you define which fields to be parsed from this worksheet.
#These fields are either "required" or "optional". "required" fields must be found
#in the worksheet so that this worksheet is valid. Otherwise this worksheet is not
#valid. The field names must match those values in the header row in the worksheet.
#
#This is a YAML file
